Discription:
The Bamboo Flute Mini Project is a music game as well as a tutorial to flute beginners. By pressing "9", "8", "7", "5", "4", "3" in certain orders on the keyboard, this program simulates the fingering and sound effect of a traditional Chinese bamboo flute. Furthermore, with a scrolling fingering music score, players could try to practice a bamboo music called "The Untamed".
